    <p>The internet space of today has been really interesting in terms of how they take up my attention. From clicks and swipes to my time of day I open an app, all are collected for the “enhancement” of my own experience. I’m profiled to scientifically and behaviorally like this group of pictures and videos in this scrollable feed. I click this shiny circle, I am rewarded with snippets of life shared by my friends and apparent that these things are all good for me supposedly. I am rewarded by being present in this app and giving my attention alone that I can drown my brain with hours and hours of pleasure-filled scrolling. And I am fine with it. My brain itself is screaming to stop but it’s violated by probably hundreds of videos now at this point that are specifically curated — referred from my stolen digital profile to successfully like.</p>
